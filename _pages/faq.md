Our blogs are soon moving to a new platform with a whole new design! We will be changing a few things and hopefully improve a lot. We'll use this page to keep you up-to-date with the bugs that have been updated, how you can discover content in the new layout, and what our team is currently working on.

To report any issues, share an idea, ask us a question, or even pay us a compliment, please use our feedback button to submit your concern directly to our blog team. Please see the bottom section for details on how to use our feedback button.

## Known Issues

This is the current list of issues that have been reported from our developer blogs. If you don't see a issue listed below, send us the details through our feedback button.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some of the questions that we've heard. If you have a different question or we didn't completely answer one, please share your thoughts through our feedback button.

**I have saved/bookmarked the URL to this blog. Will I need to change this? **

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  We have you covered. All your existing URLs will auto-redirect. However, if a link unintentionally breaks, please report it.
</p>

**What about my RSS feed? Will my feed reader still get all the latest posts?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Your RSS feed will continue to work through your previous set-up. If your RSS feed is broken, please report it with details about your feed reader.
</p>

**What happened to all the useful links in the right pane?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  These links are now at the very bottom of the page
</p>

**How do I follow the team/author?**

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  For the authors, please visit the author pages to find the appropriate social spaces to follow them at. For a blog, or related social, please see the “Follow Us” links at the very bottom of the blog.
</p>

**How do I find other developer blogs? **

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The navigation right on top will take you to our various developer blogs. Some links will take you to a blog on the new site. Others will show an error. This is because those blogs are moving to our new platform shortly. For immediate access to content on these blogs, please continue to visit the MSDN blog.
